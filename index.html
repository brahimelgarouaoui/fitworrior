                     One of the best ways to lose weight is by changing your diet.<br><br>

                     Yet, the sheer number of available diet plans may make it difficult to get started, as you’re unsure which one is most suitable, sustainable, and effective.<br><br>

                     Some diets aim to curb your appetite to reduce your food intake, while others suggest restricting your intake of calories and either carbs or fat.<br><br>

                           <h3>Warm up</h3><br>
                           <p align="left">Warming up is very important, it allows you to avoid injuring yourself by preparing the muscles you are going to use, it also allows your body to get in shape.<br><br>
                           So never skip this step which will take you 10 minutes. To warm up, you can of course do some cardio, but the most important thing is to warm up the muscles you will be working during your workout.<br><br>
                           The best way is to do one or two sets of the exercises you are going to do using very light weights, this will prepare your muscles as well as possible, which can then give their all when you really start your session.<br><br><br><br></p>

                           <h3>A basic program</h3><br>
                           <p align="left">We all want to copy the training of a successful person, whether it's your best friend, the big guy in your gym or the fitness model you admire but it is surely the worst mistake to make. Every body has specific needs and training should be tailored to meet your needs, not others. When starting out, the priority is to build the foundation and teach your body to train. Strength training is a lot like building a house: even if you love your neighbor's decorating, if you want that person's same house, you're not going to decorate it first! You will first have to build the foundation, put up the walls, the framework, etc.<br>
                           And don't forget to work the whole body and not just the pretty mirror muscles we all want to have.<br><br></p>

                           <h3>Train yourself</h3>
                           <p align="left"><br>Too often we see people who do anything, who do the wrong movements or who, to gain heavier weights, do the exercises poorly.<br>
                           Still, focusing well on performing the exercises should be your priority rather than heavier.
                           Already because it is the best way to injure yourself but also because an exercise is done to work one or more muscles. If you put on too much and can't do the movement properly, another muscle takes over so in the end, at best, it's a bit like doing another exercise.<br>
                           In the worst case, you can seriously injure yourself. So put your ego aside, especially if you are just starting out and apply yourself !!! Don't hesitate to watch exercise videos to fully understand how to do it. You can also film yourself to check that during the effort you are maintaining the correct position.</p>

                           <h3>Surpass yourself</h3><br>
                           <p align="left">playing sports is good, but you have to surpass yourself in each session and try to give your all to progress steadily. Write down your performance and at the next session, do better by adding more reps, adding a little more weight! You will see, at the beginning, you progress easily until you reach your "limits".<br>
                           It is from then that it really begins and that you will have to apply yourself in order to surpass yourself. So how do you know if you've reached your current limits or if you're using the right weights?<br><br>
                           It's very simple and here's a tip to help you situate yourself: let's say you have to do 3 sets of 10 squats. In the 3rd set, don't stop at 10, try to do your maximum reps, go to "failure".</p>

                           <h3>cardio and fitness</h3>
                           <p align="left"><br>Cardio will help you burn calories and be healthy, but it's not your best ally for toning your whole body.<br><br>
                           Strength training, on the other hand, will really build muscle and tone your body, but often doesn't burn as many calories. So do not hesitate to combine the two by doing either cardio at the end of your workout (if you start with cardio, you may be tired when doing your bodybuilding series and therefore work less well) or outside of your weight training sessions.<br><br>
                           The best, in order to lose weight and get a toned body would still be to do circuit strength training, this will combine the benefits of strength training and cardio.<br><br></p>

                           <h3>3 times a week</h3>
                           <p align="left"><br>Yes it takes time, yes it is not always easy to do so much sport, however, if you want the body of your dreams, you will have to train to match your ambitions.<br><br>
                           Personally, I train 5 times a week, which is a lot and not feasible for everyone.<br><br>
                           So I would recommend that you train at least 3 times, this is a good pace to start having good results.<br><br>
                           A simple little calculation will help you understand why: If you train twice a week, you will do around 54 training sessions / year. But if you train 4 times / week you will do 108.<br>
                           So it is normal to have more results.<br><br></p>

                           <h3>Be persistent</h3>
                           <p align="left"><br>Transforming your body takes a long time and even though you often want to go fast, it is the best way to be disappointed, frustrated because you feel like you are putting a lot of energy into it.<br><br>
                           I was so disappointed that I quickly gave up.<br><br>
                           From the moment I accepted that it would take time, I was able to hold on for the long term: I have been able to go to sport regularly for 3 years now and I have finally obtained results! I haven't changed anything in the meantime, I haven't discovered a magic formula.<br><br>
                           I just agreed to take my time and it allowed me to put a lot less pressure on myself and therefore go the distance.<br></p>

                           <h3>Eat to build</h3>
                           <p align="left"><br>Eat to build muscle...<br><br>
                           training is good, but muscles are built especially after the session, during rest. Nutrition is therefore particularly important in helping your muscles to build because it is your diet that provides your muscles with the necessary nutrients.<br><br>
                           So eat enough protein, good carbohydrates in reasonable amounts (especially around your workout), fiber and of course good fat.<br><br>

                           <h3>Have fun</h3>
                           <p align="left"><br>strength training is often seen more as a constraint than a pleasure. We are in pain, we don't necessarily have time, we are tired...<br>
                           You really have to work on it to find pleasure in it because it will help you hold out in the long term! You can force yourself for a while but it is difficult to do things that do not motivate you for a long time.<br>
                           So work to find motivation: pride in surpassing yourself, motivating results, a way of training that suits you best...<br><br>

                           By following these 10 tips for effective training, you can be sure that your results will improve and that the energy you put into your workouts will be truly effective.<br>
